## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to implement and mathematically justify the following concepts and methodologies of statistical machine learning

**Basic Statistical Concepts**

- The learning problem
- Training vs. testing
- Resampling and cross validation
- Model assessment

**Supervised Learning**

- Regression: principal components regression, Lasso, Ridge regression, Elastic net
- Classification: k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant analysis, logistic regression, naive Bayes classifiers, support vector machines
- Tree-based methods: decision trees for regression and classification, bagging, random forests, boosting
- Introduction to neural networks (if time permits)

**Unsupervised Learning**

- Clustering: k-means, hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering
- Goodness of fit and method assessment
- Biclustering


## Course Overview

### Assessment

This course will be assessed according to the following.

- **Homework Assignments** (35%) For each assignment, you will be required to upload a .pdf file to the Canvas site that contains your R code, any analyses, and any visualization used to answer the questions on the assignment. This .pdf file must be a result of compiling R code in RStudio using the knitr package. These must be submitted before the deadline set on github.
- **Case Studies** (35%) There will be several in- and out- of class case studies throughout the class. These are to be completed using RStudio.
- **Final Exam** (30%) The final exam will be comprehensive and cover all material provided in class.

### Schedule

Overall, this course will be split into three main parts: (1) regression, (2) classification, and (3) unsupervised learning and clustering.
